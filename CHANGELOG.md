### Added

- It is now possible to input multiple files
- Improved handling of `.ansi`/`.ans` files ( includes more warnings)

- Renamed `--character` input text to be **_characters_** instead of **_density_**
- Argument tests have been refactored to their own files

## [1.0.3] - 2022-05-05

### Changed

- Fixed error in windows releases building process
- Fixed error with brew tap

## [1.0.2] - 2022-05-04

### Changed

- Fixed error in windows releases

## [1.0.1] - 2022-05-04

### Changed

- Fixed error in release workflow

## [1.0.0] - 2022-05-04

### Added

- A [homebrew tap](https://github.com/FineFindus/homebrew-tap) is now available
- Cargo publishing is now done in the release workflow
- The release workflow now updates the homebrew tap
- Shell completion files and the man page are now contained in the compressed released files
- A new README sections explains how to install the completion files
- The new `--outline` flag will only produce an only of the image
- When using the `--hysteresis` flag along the `--outline` flag the ascii art will be even more outlined, with less imperfections
- Added more test cases and examples to the README to cover the newly added functionality
- Major refactoring of the code
- Artem is now a library, which is used by the command-line interface
- Due to a refactoring of the code, the output ascii image now resembles the input image more closely

### Changed

- Overhauled the installation section in the README, it now contains much more detailed installations instructions
- Switched from `f64` to `f32`, since the additional precision has literally **_no_** impact (it gets rounded/cut away), but yields worse performance
- Refactored `average_color` to be iterator based, according to some microbenchmarks, this makes it a few nanoseconds faster
- Refactored the `convert`, `blur`, `apply_sober` and `edge_tracking` functions to use `iterator`s instead of for loops. This removes a lot of nasty and hard to deal with bug, especially together with multi-threading
- Removed multithreading, it was a constant source of bugs, since pixels can't be split for threads/output characters. It also rarely brought noticeable performance improvements
- The new iterator-based implementation opens the possibility to use [rayon](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) in the future
- Fixed a crash which could occur when piping to a file using the maximum terminal size
- Fixed a bug, where the `--height` argument would not actually use the correct height and being a bit too high

## [0.6.1] - 2022-03-24

### Added

- Linux Binaries will now also be compiled with `musl`
- Completion scripts for the `.deb` will be copied in the CD process
- With mscv compiled windows binaries are available as an alternative to the gnu compiled ones
- MacOS binaries for (x86 and arm) have been added to the CD process

## [0.6.0] - 2022-03-24

### Added

- When using an html output file, artem will now converted the result to html, this also works with .ans files respectively
- More Documentation to better describe the code
- The `--border` flag can be used to create a border around the ascii image
- The `--flipX` flag can be used horizontally flip the image
- The `--flipY` flag can be used vertically flip the image
- Two more tests, which fully compare the results
